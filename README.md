The data was studied and analysed over the domain knowledge. After which,the data was cleaned to deal with the errorneous data and variables were segregated to individual entity to have a more clear understanding. Different data were merged to have a holistic idea of the customer segmentation.
The data was explored and behaviour was analysed to give the insights of the data. A list of potential customers were predicted over the new customers.
